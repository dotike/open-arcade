# Installer operations sketch, to perform a UNIX style install:

# Set explicit defaults (user can override via inline env?)
# Possibly provide separate Makefile install option to install into "~/"
# Note: these are just stub example paths,
PREFIX=$HOME
ATMP="${ATMP:-/tmp}"

# All that follows *could* be done cleanly using install(1)
# utilities install paths:
  bin/*  -> ${PREFIX}/bin/
  sbin/* -> ${PREFIX}/sbin/
  etc/*  -> ${PREFIX}/etc/

  lib/python/* -> ${PYTHONPATH}
  # this install *could* happen using some pythonic machinery, or, simply install(1)
  # note: lib names must reference 'arcade' to keep things clear
  # note: vendored libs must be isolated using 'arcade' name to keep them separate

# subsystems install paths:
  gravitar  -> ${PREFIX}/arcade/gravitar
  galaga    -> ${PREFIX}/arcade/galaga
  asteroids -> ${PREFIX}/arcade/asteroids
  ? narc    -> ${PREFIX}/arcade/narc or ${PREFIX}/arcade/asteroids/narc

# things not installed in the system, (or, if they are, simply stuff them in "${PREFIX}/arcade/")
