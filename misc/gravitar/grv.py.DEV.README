For development simplicity, this libexec directory should contain a symbolic
link to our grv.py library, e.g.

  ./grv.py -> ../lib/python/grv.py

This symbolic link should not be included in the final installation, as the
grv library will simply be installed in our pythonpath, (or, the pythonpath
on local installation will be appended with our library dir.)

This symlink allows us to simply 'import grv' in our applications, with no
gotchas or edge cases to worry about.
