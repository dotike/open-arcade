Project 2: ASD uploader tool features

#### Feature 1, validation:
- Validate based on a JSON schema (any boilerplate from internet will do)
  - Place JSON schema in the root of the ASD bucket, as known file URI

Block writes for file upload, until JSON is validated against schema:
  - start keeping schema source in repo, as schema content source of truth for now
  - tool should fetch the one in the S3 bucket, for validation before upload

#### Feature 2, initialize when new S3 bucket is created for ASD:
- begin ‘init’ tool: initialization tooling for S3 bucket
  - upload JSON schema to S3 bucket (only feature of ‘init’ for now
  - leave room for future ‘init’ needs,
    (other things to massage in S3 bucket before asd tool is usable)
  - aim for idempotency, (e.g. if file exists, simply overwrite it)
  - init can be feature of asd tool, or separate small tool, whatever works

#### Feature 3, basic search
- Ability to perform searches for files based on date ranges.
  - Given some date range at the CLI, return all URI paths which exist.
  - command line flags for date formatting up to you, I suggest
    mimicking some UNIX utility like cal(1) or date(1)

#### BONUS: Feature 4,
If you have time, it’s worth taking a whack at an installer for asd.
Installation intent:
- Install the asd tool(s) on a UNIX system, in user's the $PATH
- Intent that the tool be installed and usable *without* the git repository available.
- Rough pass expected here, using any installer technology which is generally portable across UNIX systems, (We use our Mac systems, and at the moment, Ubuntu).

#### BONUS: Feature 5, (from chat discussion),
- Feature, provide fetch/download of the file content,
  when asd is provided the URI of an uploaded file
- First pass, printing JSON to stdout is more than adequate.

#### “Stub” for future requirements
- Some idea of minimal ‘configuration’ for ASD is inevitable, specifically:
  - config to point ASD at specific S3 bucket
  - it would be useful if asd config be override-able via ENV variables
  - we use ~/.namedtool config as a convention already, but open to new ideas

#### Sharing other code from discussion earlier,
- Our “Gravitar” layer uses this tool:
