Project 1: ASD uploader tool (Asteroid Service Directory)

#### Tool Description

A command line utility which,
- allows upload of a text/JSON file to S3
- returns a unique identifier/path where the file can always be read
  - re-uploading files of the same name *must* return unique identifier
Uploaded files are intended to be kept and accessible indefinitely.

#### Requirements

- Must store files in structure on S3 which does not just pile up millions or hundreds of millions of files in the same bucket directory.  Implementation suggestions:
  - hashradix (overkill example discussed, 
    e.g. md5/a-f 16 ascii chars, by 32 ascii chars deep)
    - downside: complex to implement, *very hard* to find 
      files if you loose the hash/path location.
  - dateradix (recommended approach)
    - YYYY/MM/DD/HH etc… however granular seems sane
    - upside: naturally makes implementation of date-range 
      based searches, or future search indexing, much simpler.
    - upside: makes it easy to implement glacier-like features
      to archive old data.
We’re totally open to other ideas, ike is happy to discuss or be a sounding board if you want to discuss a different direction.

- Must be a command line utility with the following attributes:
  - must accept input as command line option
    - bonus/fancy-stuff: doing it as stdin *and* optarg would be awesome, but also overkill.
  - must return unique file path to stdout
  - must return all error/debug output to stderr

- One key feature is required up front: ‘-h’ help output
  - can be written like a UNIX man page, or simpler


#### Soft Requirements

- Intended to be written in python3, (>=3.6 I guess), with only dependency being boto3
  - python libraries outside of python standard lib require *serious* need
- Intended to be as boringly portable as possible (across *NIX systems, that is)


#### Implementation Preferences

- program name is up to you for now, 
  something short/simple like ‘asd’ is preferred.
- Simpler is better in the implementation,
  - This program will be extended in the future, don’t 
    make it perfect, just stay organized.
  - We prefer simple functional styles of programming,
    for “operator barbarian” maintainability.
  - classes/factory/OOP/etc patterns *must* have a 
    clearly documented rationale.

#### “Stub” for future requirements

Do not go crazy implementing this week, just be aware for next step requirements:
- Ability to pre-validate JSON before uploading, based on a JSON schema (TBD)
- Ability to perform searches for files based on date ranges.
- AWS role needs (readonly vs. read-write users, etc…)
- Functional testing ability is key in the future
  - (unit testing is all you, we just care that the program works)
- Ability to be installed without requiring a ton of files to be dragged along with it.
  - installer to $PATH may happen in future in this tool, or, as part of other suite.
