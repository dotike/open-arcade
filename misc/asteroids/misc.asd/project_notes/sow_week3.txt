Project 3: button up ASD

#### Objective
Wrap up the Asteroid Service Directory tooling as though it’s going to sit on
the shelf a while. Next week we’ll embark on a similar new tool, which uses
data in the Asteroid Service Directory.

- Wrap up any loose ends or cleanup.

#### TO-DO:
Installer Clean Up:
- reqs.py for dependencies
- setup.py functional for installation
- Basic Install Instructions in README.txt in root of repo
- Ensure all tooling arguments are consistent across programs
Bug:
- ‘-v’ ‘-V’ broken

#### Documentation:
- README.txt - please take ownership of it and make sure it makes sense for
  some new user.
- docstrings for all methods
- Documentation about JSON schema in base, add to README.txt
  (Just point out that it’s there)

#### Bonus:
If installer is capable of generating pip-compatible output, instructions
for making the pip asset would be handy to have for the future.

#### Notes:
- decision was made together, no config file is necessary for the tool,
  (Particularly AOK as bucket flag can be set via ENV)
- decision 

#### Future Considerations:
- Testing, opening this can of worms slowly:
  - How can we functionally test the tooling?
    - Can we use setup.py for barbarians to run tests (oldschool py)
  - How could we provide test instruction to QA if we had their cycles?
