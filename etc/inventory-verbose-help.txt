This tool, inventory.py, is used to generate an inventory of all AWS
resources assigned to an arcade. An arcade can be visualized as a 3
layer cake. The bottom layer is known as the gravitar layer, it is
essentially an AWS VPC with a number of AWS resources and opinionated
configuration added on.

The second layer is known as the galaga layer, it contains additonal
AWS resources and acts as an absract glue layer between the gravatar
and asteroid layer. The top level is the asteroid layer, which
provides deployment tools for product services.

The inventory.py tool allows the user get a formatted listing of the
various layers and a comprehensive inventory. By default, inventory.py,
outputs to stdout a comprehensive inventory of all layers in a human
readable json. The following is an example of how get this with an
example arcade name:

  arcade inventory -A strong_bad.arc

The tool can also write the output to a file by adding the -o
option. This create the formatted json string and write to a file in
the directory $HOME/tmp/arcade/file_name.json. The following is an
example:

  arcade inventory -A strong_bad.arc -o
  Wrote inventory manifest to /home/bob.dobbs/tmp/arcade/strong_bad.arc-asteroid-inventory.json
